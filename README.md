<i>A little about me</i>:

:sparkles I am currently in my last stages of my Engineering Management MSc degree, putting my adaptability skills into practice and entering the world of Tech! I love travelling, exploring different cultures and trying new cuisines. When I'm not working on my dissertation or full-time DevOps training I enjoy yoga, playing squash & hiking :sparkles
